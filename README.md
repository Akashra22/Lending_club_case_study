# Lending club case study

The lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). 
Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. 
In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. 
In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'. 
If one is able to identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. 
Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.

## General Information

The main objective of the project is to give a idea for the loan approval based on certain criteria that there won't be business loss or financial loss to the company.
If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company.
If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.
